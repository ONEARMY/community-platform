# 🌍 &nbsp; Onearmy

A platform to connect, educate and empower our global community (65K) to solve society's greatest challenges. Together. As One Army.

## 🤖 &nbsp; Technologies

The platform is built in **React** and use [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/index.html) for state management, [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html) for typing and consistency, and [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) for reusability and component based styling.
