# What is Supabase?

Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative, based on Postgres.

## Getting Started

To install the supabase locally, follow https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started?queryGroups=platform&platform=windows
Installing as a dev dependency doesn't always work well, so it is recommended to install for your OS.

Install Docker Desktop.
Make sure you have the docker app open.

Run `supabase start` (Ensure you run it on the project folder root.)
Run `supabase status`
Create a .env.local file at the project root (same level as .env) and fill in the keys with values from the command above:
SUPABASE_API_URL={API URL}
SUPABASE_KEY={anon key}
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY={service_role key}

Create a `public` bucket named `precious-plastic` for local dev.
Add the policy named `tenant_isolation` for all operations: `(bucket_id = ((current_setting('request.headers'::text, true))::json ->> 'x-tenant-id'::text))`
Ideally this would be automated.

## Running Cypress Tests

Create a .env.local file at the packages/cypress folder
SUPABASE_API_URL=your_api_key (probably http://127.0.0.1:54321)
SUPABASE_KEY=your_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your service key

All done! Tests will use your local database. More info about how it works below.

## Migrations

After making schema changes, use the this command to create a migration file:
`supabase db diff --file [migration_name]`

## Supabase Edge Functions

Currently used for customizing Auth Emails.
Supabase Auth Hooks have a timeout of 5 seconds which can easily be exceeded. To reduce the risk, the `resend` call is not awaited.
If it is exceeded, the user gets an error on the UI, but still receives the email and can continue his flow.
Haven't managed to run the functions locally yet (contributions welcome!).

### Cypress with Supabase

Running cypress tests locally will use the local database, while running on CI will use the QA database.
For each test run, a new tenant_id is generated, which has a few benefits:

- ensures no conflicts between parallel test runs
- easier to cleanup
- if the data isn't cleaned for some reason, it won't affect other runs
  For each test file, there should be a `before` and `after` block to, respectively, seed and clean the database.

### Local firebase sync testing/debugging

_This is temporary until we fully migrate to supabase!_
We can create and deploy the sync function to the firebase dev environment.
Then, using ngrok, expose our local supabase url to the internet, and point the firebase function to it.
(ngrok http http://127.0.0.1:54321)

To authenticate, we need to create these 3 secrets, for each firebase project:
firebase functions:secrets:set SUPABASE_API_URL
firebase functions:secrets:set SUPABASE_API_KEY
firebase functions:secrets:set TENANT_ID
(Check values with firebase functions:secrets:access SECRET_NAME)

## Technical Decisions

### Multi-tenant

Multi-tenancy is a requirement because:

- Single login for all websites.
- Easier maintenance and migrations.

With supabase there are a few ways we can do multi-tenancy:

1. Have Multiple projects
2. Have a Single project with multiple schemas
3. Have a Single project, with 1 common schema, using RLS (Row Level Security) to ensure data separation

Decision: 3. Why?

- A single project is easier to manage and deploy
- Same for a single common schema... and multiple schemas wouldn't give any security benefits
- With RLS, we can ensure, based on a Environment Variable, only the respective rows of that tenant are queried.

How?

- Each table has a tenant_id column
- On each request, to supabase (via it's sdk) we pass a header 'x-tenant-id' with the process.env.TENANT_ID variable, which is set for each app, via Fly.io secret.

### Comment Counts

Currently we can sort questions/research/library by the number of comments.
With supabase there are a few ways we can do this:

1. A comment count view
2. A comment count materialized view
3. Triggers, where the main table has a comment_count column which is updated when a comment is inserted/deleted

Decision: 3. Why?

- A simple view isn't performant, would be querying for the total on each query.
- A materialized view keeps state and is simple enough to update it, but doesn't support RLS. (Would be a better contender if it supported RLS)

How?

- Whenever a comment is created or deleted, it triggers the update_comment_count function.
- The function checks the Operation kind (Insert/Delete), the source_type and source_id.
- Fron the source_type it will update the according content total (library, research, questions) that matches the source_id
