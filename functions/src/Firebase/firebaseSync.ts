/*  Functions in this folder are used to sync data between firestore and firebase realtime databases
    The reason for this is to allow large collections to be 'cached' for cheap retrieval
    An example would be the map pins. When a user first visits the map all pins are downloaded
    The previous map had 30,000 pins, so this would cost roughly $0.02c, or $20 per 1000 users
    By pulling the data from firebase realtime instead and only subscribing to updates, this is
    dramatically reduced. For more information about the various database strategies see:
