/**
 * Building Functions
 *
 * The backend functions have various reference to code both in the main platform and shared folders
 * As this is not supported well by firebase functions (see issue below), webpack is used to
 * compile the full bundle, with code from shared folders included.
 *
 * As the main platform code needs to be compiled in a custom way (e.g. so 'src/' is recognised),
 * this is compiled to output typings to a lib folder before webpack is run.
 * Webpack accesses these files through it's own node_modules installation which has a symlink
 * to the rest of the platform code
