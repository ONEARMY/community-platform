      Notice the use of ./public in the tags above.

      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.

      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.


      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "./favicon.ico" will

      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.

      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
