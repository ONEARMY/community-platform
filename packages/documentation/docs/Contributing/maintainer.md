**Want to support the core project even more?**  
That's awesome! As well as the bounty system we also encourage anyone interested to join our Core Developers or Maintainers team.

These roles include tasks like:

- Code reviews
- Code quality improvements
- Devops and general optimisations
- Security and general updates
- Documentation
- Issue management

There is a separate hourly payscale for these roles, aimed at developers who help a bit more consistently at around 2-3h per week. If you're interested in these roles then feel free to reach out on slack or during the monthly dev call.
