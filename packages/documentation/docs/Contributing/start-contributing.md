## What is my role?

By default we consider everyone that submits a PR a contributor. People that contribute regularly and want to get more involved can become maintainers to help new contributors. People here for the long term are core maintainers and work on the core of the platform. Here is an overview of the roles

# Rewards:

### Recognising Contributors

We have adopted [all contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) and their tooling for managing the contributors listing on the [project README.me](https://github.com/ONEARMY/community-platform/blob/master/README.md).

After merging a new contributors PR:

1. Add a comment to the merged PR mentioning the bot, contributor and their contribution [type](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key), for example: `@all-contributors add @githubUsername for code`
2. A PR will be automatically raised, [example](https://github.com/ONEARMY/community-platform/pull/1952)
3. The PR raised by the All Contributors bot will need to be merged with admin privileges as the required CI skips are deliberately skipped.

### Payment

Each role get paid a bit differently. Contributors and maintainers get paid according to the [Bounty system](/Contributing/bounties). For core maintainers there is a separate hourly pay scale. Aimed at developers who help a bit more consistently at around 2-3h per week. If you're interested in these roles then feel free to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/SSBrzeR) or during the monthly dev call.
