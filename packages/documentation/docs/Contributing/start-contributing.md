## What is my role?

# In more detail:

### Recognising Contributors

We have adopted [all contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) and their tooling for managing the contributors listing on the [project README.me](https://github.com/ONEARMY/community-platform/blob/master/README.md).

After merging a new contributors PR:

1. Add a comment to the merged PR mentioning the bot, contributor and their contribution [type](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key), for example: `@all-contributors add @githubUsername for code`
2. A PR will be automatically raised, [example](https://github.com/ONEARMY/community-platform/pull/1952)
3. The PR raised by the All Contributors bot will need to be merged with admin privileges as the required CI skips are deliberately skipped.

### Payment

Each role get paid a bit differently. Contributors and maintainers get paid according to the [Bounty system](/Contributing/bounties). For core maintainers there is a separate hourly pay scale. Aimed at developers who help a bit more consistently at around 2-3h per week. If you're interested in these roles then feel free to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/SSBrzeR) or during the monthly dev call.
