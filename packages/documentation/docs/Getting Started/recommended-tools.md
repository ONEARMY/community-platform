Additionally there are a couple extensions that work well with our current technology stack:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) to type-check code
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) to auto-format code
