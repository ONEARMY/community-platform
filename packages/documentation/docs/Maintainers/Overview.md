Maintainers play a crucial role in ensuring the success and sustainability of our project.

Maintainers are responsible for a variety of tasks, including reviewing and merging pull requests, triaging issues, and coordinating releases. You also play an important role in setting the direction and vision for the project, working with the community to define goals and prioritize features.

# Maintainer rate

We have an hourly amount available for maintainers to help on the platform. We would love to increase this in the future and get a bit closer to the industry standard. But resources are limited with an Open Source Project. So for now we depend on very awesome maintainers :)
