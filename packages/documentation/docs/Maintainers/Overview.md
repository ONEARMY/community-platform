Welcome to the maintainer documentation for the Platform project! As a maintainer, you play a crucial role in ensuring the success and sustainability of our project. This documentation is designed to provide you with the information and resources you need to effectively manage the project and collaborate with other contributors.

As a maintainer, you are responsible for a variety of tasks, including reviewing and merging pull requests, triaging issues, and coordinating releases. You also play an important role in setting the direction and vision for the project, working with the community to define goals and prioritize features.

In this documentation, you'll find information on project governance, community guidelines, and best practices for maintaining the project.

We're grateful for your contributions as a maintainer, and we hope this documentation will help you navigate the challenges and opportunities of open source development. Let's work together to build something great!

# Maintainer rate

We have an hourly amount available for maintainers to help on the platform. We would love to increase this in the future and get a bit closer to the industry standard. But resources are limited with an Open Source Project. So for now we depend on very awesome maintainers :)
