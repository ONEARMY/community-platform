Scientists are still figuring out the long-term effects, but some studies suggest they can mess with hormones and digestion. Makes you think twice about drinking from plastic bottles!"

BPA, phthalates, all that stuff—these can leach into food and drinks, and they've been linked to hormonal imbalances and fertility issues. And yet, plastic is everywhere! Hard to avoid completely, but switching to glass or stainless steel can help reduce exposure."
