## About Forms

The platform uses react-final-form as a state management tool for handling form data.
https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form

It does not provide any of its own components, instead offering a `<Field />` wrapper that can
take any existing component and hook into value and onChange props as required.

The components in this folder are a combination of styled/wrapped standard input components, and wrappers for custom components
which sit outside of the main directory.
