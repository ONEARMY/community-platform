tags will be stored for use across the platform. it is intended that tags will be grouped by category to display together,
such as machines. It is also intended image will contain a binary string of the actual image data.
This should be kept small (max db size for an entry is around 1MB, but this should only be a few kb)
when building tag uploader it should enforce reasonable max size image (say 500px x 500px)
