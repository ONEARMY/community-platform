      <p>
        By using the platform, these terms will automatically platformly to you
        – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before
        using the platform. The platform code is licensed as MIT, and full
        details of the code license can be found on{' '}

      </p>
      <p>
        You are not allowed to otherwise copy, modify or use trademarks found
        within the platform in any way. All the trade marks, copyright, database
        rights and other intellectual property rights related to this platform
        instance belong to Precious Plastic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stichting OneArmy is committed to ensuring that the platform is as
        useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right
        to make changes to the platform or to charge for its services, at any
        time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the platform or
        its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
        paying for.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should be aware that there are certain things that Stichting OneArmy
        will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the platform will
        require the platform have an active internet connection. The connection
        can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Stichting
        OneArmy cannot take responsibility for the platform not working at full
        functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any
        of your data allowance left.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re using the platform outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
        remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
        provider will still platformly. As a result, you may be charged by your
        mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection
        while accessing the platform, or other third party charges. In using the
        platform, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges,
        including roaming data charges if you use the platform outside of your
        home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
        roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re
        using the platform, please be aware that we assume that you have
        received permission from the bill payer for using the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the same lines, Stichting OneArmy cannot always take
        responsibility for the way you use the platform i.e. You need to make
        sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you
        can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Stichting OneArmy cannot accept
        responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        With respect to Stichting OneArmy’s responsibility for your use of the
        platform, when you’re using the platform, it’s important to bear in mind
        that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at
        all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so
        that we can make it available to you. Stichting OneArmy accepts no
        liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result
        of relying wholly on this functionality of the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        At some point, we may wish to update the platform. The requirements for
        system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
        availability of the platform to) may change, and you’ll need to download
        the updates if you want to keep using the platform. Stichting OneArmy
        does not promise that it will always update the platform so that it is
        relevant to you and/or works with the version that you have previously
        used. However, you promise to always accept updates to the
        platformlication when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing
        the platform, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving
        notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any
        termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms
        will end; (b) you must stop using the platform.
