          By using the platform, these terms will automatically platformly to
          you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully
          before using the platform. The platform code is licensed as MIT, and
          full details of the code license can be found on{' '}

        <p>
          You are not allowed to otherwise copy, modify or use trademarks found
          within the platform in any way. All the trade marks, copyright,
          database rights and other intellectual property rights related to this
          platform instance belong to Precious Plastic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stichting OneArmy is committed to ensuring that the platform is as
          useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the
          right to make changes to the platform or to charge for its services,
          at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the
          platform or its services without making it very clear to you exactly
          what you’re paying for.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should be aware that there are certain things that Stichting
          OneArmy will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the
          platform will require the platform have an active internet connection.
          The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network
          provider, but Stichting OneArmy cannot take responsibility for the
          platform not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to
          Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re using the platform outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should
          remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network
          provider will still platformly. As a result, you may be charged by
          your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the
          connection while accessing the platform, or other third party charges.
          In using the platform, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
          charges, including roaming data charges if you use the platform
          outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without
          turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device
          on which you’re using the platform, please be aware that we assume
          that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the
          platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the same lines, Stichting OneArmy cannot always take
          responsibility for the way you use the platform i.e. You need to make
          sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
          you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Stichting OneArmy cannot
          accept responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          With respect to Stichting OneArmy’s responsibility for your use of the
          platform, when you’re using the platform, it’s important to bear in
          mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
          correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide
          information to us so that we can make it available to you. Stichting
          OneArmy accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you
          experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the
          platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          At some point, we may wish to update the platform. The requirements
          for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the
          availability of the platform to) may change, and you’ll need to
          download the updates if you want to keep using the platform. Stichting
          OneArmy does not promise that it will always update the platform so
          that it is relevant to you and/or works with the version that you have
          previously used. However, you promise to always accept updates to the
          platformlication when offered to you, We may also wish to stop
          providing the platform, and may terminate use of it at any time
          without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you
          otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted
          to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the platform.
