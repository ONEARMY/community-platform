Built with [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/) for styling.\\n\\nThese components are stored within the [Community Platform monorepo](https://github.com/ONEARMY/community-platform) and configured as a standalone package using [Yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces/).  \\nThe aim of packaging these components separately is to:\\n\\n1. Encourage separation between presentation layer and business logic\\n2. Reduce the overhead for contributors looking to work **only** on the component layer without needing to spin up the entire application locally.\\n\\nWe are using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to provide a browser accessible interface for our components.\\n\\n> Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to start up a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.\\n\\n(Optional) For anyone unfamiliar with Storybook looking to better understand the tool, we recommend reading their guide on [What's a Story](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/whats-a-story).\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\nAfter [cloning the repo](https://github.com/ONEARMY/community-platform), you can start the Storybook instance, which will make the application available in your browser at [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006/).\\n\\n```\\ncd ./packages/components\\nyarn install\\nyarn start\\n```\\n\\n## Creating a new Component\\n\\nYou can quickly create a new component using the command `yarn new-component MyNewComponentName`, which\\nwill generate the following items:\\n\\n```\\nsrc/\\n  MyNewComponentName/\\n    MyNewComponentName.tsx # Component\\n    MyNewComponentName.stories.tsx # Storybook documentation\\n```\\n\"","import { Meta, Markdown } from '@storybook/blocks'\n\nimport ReadMe from '../README.md?raw'\n\n<Meta title=\"Welcome\" />\n\n<Markdown>{ReadMe}</Markdown>\n"],"names":["ReadMe","MDXContent","props","MDXLayout","_provideComponents","_jsx","_createMdxContent","_jsxs","_Fragment","Meta","Markdown"],"mappings":"umBAAA,MAAeA,EAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,ECKf,SAASC,EAAWC,EAAQ,GAAI,CAC9B,KAAM,CAAC,QAASC,CAAS,EAAI,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAEC,EAAoB,EAAEF,EAAM,UAAU,EACrF,OAAOC,EAAYE,EAAKF,EAAW,OAAO,OAAO,CAAE,EAAED,EAAO,CAC1D,SAAUG,EAAKC,EAAmB,EAAE,CACxC,CAAG,CAAC,EAAIA,IACN,SAASA,GAAoB,CAC3B,OAAOC,EAAMC,EAAW,CACtB,SAAU,CAACH,EAAKI,EAAM,CACpB,MAAO,SACf,CAAO,EAAG;AAAA,EAAMJ,EAAKK,EAAU,CACvB,SAAUV,CAClB,CAAO,CAAC,CACR,CAAK,CACF,CACH"}
